    In the second method, we will create an array of objects as we did in the first method.
    That is, we will be using the constructor to instantiate the objects.
    But we will use a single-line approach to instantiate the objects.
    We will call the constructor the time we create the array to hold the objects.
    We can write the constructor call in a single line inside the {} array notation.
    We will create the objects of the Customer class in the Store class.


    For example, create an array arr as in the first method.
    But instead of allocating the memory for the objects, create the objects in the same line.
    Write an array {} notation after the new Customer[]. Next, create two objects of
    the Customer class with the new keyword. Supply the respective id and name as the parameters
    to the constructor. Use a comma to separate each constructor call.
