    /*
    We can create an array of an object using the [] array notation in Java.
    We can use the constructor to initialize the objects by passing the values to it.
    The syntax of the expression is shown below.

    Type[] objectName = new ClassName[];*/

/*
    The Type denotes the type of the object. It may be of a specific data type or a CLASS type.
    The [] symbol means==> creating an array.
    The option "objectName" = name of the object.
    The "new" operator CREATES an instance. The ClassName refers to the name of the
    class whose object is made. We can specify the size of the array in the [] after the class.
    We can use the index in the array to instantiate each object.

/*             THIS IS A QUESTION FOR CREATING OBJECT
    Create a class Store to write the main method to it.
    Inside the main method, create an array arr of the Customer type
    and allocate the memory for two Customer classesâ€™ objects.
    Create two objects of the Customer class from the indexed array arr.
    Supply the values 709270 and Robert for the first object and 709219 and
    Neal for the second object while creating the object.

    These values are the parameters for the constructor of the Customer class.
    Then call the display() function with the created objects.

    The Customer class contains the public properties id and name.
    The constructor of the class sets the values for these properties.
    The public function display() displays the property of the class.
    In the example below, the objects are created from an array,
    and the constructor is invoked during the creation of the object.
        Then, the objects call the display() function, and the output is displayed.
    So far, we have learned how to create an array of objects and use it with the methods.
            */
