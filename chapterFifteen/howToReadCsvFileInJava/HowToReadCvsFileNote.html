    How to Read CSV file in Java

    In past articles, we studied how to read an excel file in Java. In this article,
    we will discuss how to read a CSV file in Java using different methods.
    The data is multiplying with time; all such data is kept in these CSV files.

    There is a need to understand the techniques to read these files using Java.
    We will learn all such methods in this article. So, letâ€™s start discussing this topic.
    What is CSV file?
    The CSV file stands for the Comma-Separated Values file. It is a simple plain-text file
    format that stores tabular data in columns in simple text forms, such as a spreadsheet or database,
    and splits it by a separator. The separator used to split the data usually is commas (,).

    We can import files in the CSV format and export them using programs like Microsoft Office and Excel,
    which store data in tables. The CSV file uses a delimiter to identify and separate different data tokens in a file.

    The use of the CSV file format is when we move tabular data between programs that natively operate on
    incompatible formats.
    Creating CSV File

    We can create a CSV file in the following two ways:

    Using Microsoft Excel
    Using Notepad editor

    1. Using Microsoft Excel
