Weâ€™ll create an ArrayList in the main() method and will share it to the two different
        classes i.e. the Read and the Write class.
        The Write class will add elements to an ArrayList and another Read class will read
        elements from the same ArrayList. Logic is simple. Create a list using an
        java.util.ArrayList in the main() of the Sample class. Pass the same ArrayList
        to constructor of both Read and Write class constructor and initialize the list fields of both class. Perform operations add or remove on that list.
        NOTE: If two objects are performing read and write operation on same shared list,
        we need to synchronize the list to avoid exception. So, we will be Synchronizing
        the ArrayList using Collection.synchronizdList.

        We create two different Classes: A-->Class Write, B----class Read
